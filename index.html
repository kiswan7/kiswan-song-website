Once, I was seven years old, my mama told me
"Go make yourself some friends, or you'll be lonely"
 Once, I was seven years old
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="div-lyrics">
              <p>
It was a big-big world, but we thought we were bigger
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
By 11, smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
Never rich, so we were out to make that steady figure
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="div-lyrics">
                <p>
Once, I was 11 years old, my daddy told me
"Go get yourself a wife, or you'll be lonely"
Once, I was 11 years old
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="div-lyrics">
                <p>
I always had that dream like my daddy before me
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about the glory just always seemed to bore me
'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="div-lyrics">
                <p>
Once, I was 20 years old, my story got told
Before the morning sun, when life was lonely
Once, I was 20 years old
(Lukas Graham!)
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="div-lyrics">
                <p>
I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure
'Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major
I got my boys with me, at least those in favor
And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later

                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="div-lyrics">
                <p>
Once, I was 20 years old, my story got told
I was writing 'bout everything, I saw before me
Once, I was 20 years old
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="div-lyrics">

Soon, we'll be 30 years old, our songs have been sold
We've traveled around the world, and we're still roaming
Soon, we'll be 30 years old
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="div-lyrics">
                <p>
I'm still learning about life, my woman brought children for me
So I can sing them all my songs, and I can tell them stories
Most of my boys are with me, some are still out seeking glory
And some I had to leave behind, my brother, I'm still sorry
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="div-lyrics">
                <p>
Soon, I'll be 60 years old, my daddy got 61
Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
I made the man so happy when I wrote a letter once
I hope my children come and visit, once or twice a month
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="div-lyrics">
                <p>
Soon, I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold?
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me?
Soon, I'll be 60 years old
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="div-lyrics">
                <p>
Soon, I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold?
Or will I have a lot of children who can hold me?
Soon, I'll be 60 years old
